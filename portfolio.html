    <h1>   For our project we decided to make a crossy road type game with a minion and we decided to ask the player if you wish minion good luck and if you say yes he will happly go accross the road without getting hit by the car, but if you say no he turns sad then gets hit by the car and the game is over. We also had an extra option where if you say banana the minion will pick up a banana and wont go on the road.</h1>

    <h1>   For our project we decided to make an ice fishing game that spawns fish's at random and you are trying to catch as much fish's as you can in a time of 30 seconds if you get higher than the people on the leaderboard in 30 seconds then you make it to the leaderboard. You catch the fish by moving your rod up and down and trying to make the hook hit the fish. If you hit one fish you get 5 points.</h1>

    <h1>   For our scratch project we decided to make a tour of france where a player walks around diffrent sites of france and reacts to it. We made it so you click the right arrow to walk and when you reach the end of the screen it changes backrounds. We also added music to the game and at the beginng it has a diffrent costume from when shes talking to walking. And at the end of the story it asks you if you want to play agin and if you clikc y then you restart the game.</h1>

    <h1>   For our pltw project we decided to choose the inland forest as the planet. This is because for the 4 senses we decided to make the graph thats negative movement, we decided to make the graph that goes up and down alot sound, we decided to make the one that randomly shoots up, light, and lastly we decided the one that looks like a wave that goes up and down a couple times, the temprature. With this information we saw that the marsh lands looks the most accurate to the planets information because the marsh land has smooth tempratures like the planet and low light during the day which isnt as accurate but not to far apart from the planet, and has a constant howl of the wind, occasional thunderstorms  just like the sound of the planet, and lastly has little to no wind which is true for the movement of the planet.</h1>
